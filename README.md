# Plugin Template

This is an example plugin template that makes use of the available `plugins-commons` library.

### Building the plugin

To build the plugin you will need to clone the following repositories (at the same level as this repository):

 - [mavenBuildConfig](https://github.com/sda-community-plugins/mavenBuildConfig)
 - [plugins-build-parent](https://github.com/sda-community-plugins/plugins-build-parent)
 - [air-plugin-build-script](https://github.com/sda-community-plugins/air-plugin-build-script)
 
 and then compile using the following command
 '''
   mvn clean package
 '''
